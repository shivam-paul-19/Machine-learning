    "# **Logistic Regression**\n",
    "Logistic regression is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification tasks where the goal is to predict the probability that an instance belongs to a given class or not. Logistic regression is a statistical algorithm which analyze the relationship between two data factors. The article explores the fundamentals of logistic regression, it’s types and implementations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Logistic regression is used for binary classification where we use sigmoid function, that takes input as independent variables and produces a probability value between 0 and 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we have two classes Class 0 and Class 1 if the value of the logistic function for an input is greater than 0.5 (threshold value) then it belongs to Class 1 otherwise it belongs to Class 0. It’s referred to as regression because it is the extension of linear regression but is mainly used for classification problems."
