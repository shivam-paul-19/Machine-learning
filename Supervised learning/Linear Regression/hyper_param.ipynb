    "## Ridge regression\n",
    "Ridge Regression is a machine learning technique that enhances linear regression by adding an L2 penalty to the loss function, shrinking coefficients to prevent overfitting, especially with many correlated features (multicollinearity). It introduces bias to reduce variance, creating more stable, generalized models that perform better on new data by penalizing large coefficient values, unlike standard regression that can become unstable. \n",

    "### The problem of overfitting\n",
    "overfitting is a condition where a model performs too well on the test data set, this is actually not a desirable situation as this can the model to be highly baised towards the test data set and it is high chance that the model won't perform well on the **train data set** or **new points**\n",

    "Lasso regression is a method that performs both variable selection and regularization by adding a penalty term to the standard linear regression (Ordinary Least Squares) objective function. It is specifically known for its use of the L1 norm as a penalty, which enables the model to produce \"sparse\" solutions—meaning some coefficients are reduced to exactly zero.\n"
