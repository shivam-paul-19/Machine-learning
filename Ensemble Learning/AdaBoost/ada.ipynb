    "# **AdaBoost** 🧬\n",
    "AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting) is a powerful ensemble learning algorithm that combines multiple \"weak\" machine learning models (like shallow decision trees, or stumps) sequentially to create one \"strong\", highly accurate classifier or regressor. It works by iteratively training models, giving more weight to data points that previous models misclassified, making subsequent models focus on correcting those errors, thus adapting to the data's weaknesses. It's known for its effectiveness in classification but can be sensitive to noisy data and outliers.\n",

    "## The working\n",
    "- ### Creating stumps\n",
    "A stump is a *week learner*, a single model that takes the data and get trained on it. Even in making a week learner (stump), our focus should be on making the best stump with least error. The error made by one stump is handled by the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Calculating weights and total error\n",
    "Every data point of the training data set is assigned a by-default weight $ w_{i} $. When the stump makes any wronf prediction, the weights of the wronf records are added to calculate $ total\\ error $. In regression extra steps are done to calculate this.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ w_{i} = 1/N,\\ [N = number\\ of\\ records] $$\n",
    "$$ ... $$\n",
    "$$ in\\ classification: $$\n",
    "$$ total\\ error = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_{i} $$\n",
    "$$ k = number\\ of\\ wrong\\ predictions $$\n",
    "$$ w_{i} = weights\\ of\\ wrong\\ predictions $$\n",
    "$$ ... $$\n",
    "$$ in\\ regression: $$\n",
    "$$ e_{i} = |y - ŷ|,\\ [absolute\\ error] $$\n",
    "$$ L_{i} = \\frac {e_{i}}{max(e_{i})} $$\n",
    "$$ total\\ error = \\sum_{i=1}^{k} w_{i}*L_{i} $$\n",
    "$$ k = number\\ of\\ wrong\\ predictions $$\n",
    "$$ w_{i} = weights\\ of\\ wrong\\ predictions $$\n",
    "$$ L_{i} = Normalised\\ error\\ of\\ wrong\\ predictions $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Calculating performance of stump\n",
    "λ is calculated for the stump which indicated it's performance.\n",
    "$$ λ = \\frac {1}{2} * log_{e}(\\frac {1-total\\ error}{total\\ error}) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Updating weights\n",
    "Our aim is to reduce the weights of correctly predicted points and increase the weight of wrongly classified one.\\\n",
    "The weights are updated with way:\n",
    "$$ w_{i} = w_{i} * e^{-p},\\ for\\ correctly\\ classified\\ weights. $$\n",
    "$$ w_{i} = w_{i} * e^{p},\\ for\\ incorrectly\\ classified\\ weights. $$\n",
    "$$ p = performance\\ of\\ the\\ stump. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "After this updation, we will *normalise* the weights so that the summation becomes **1**.\n",
    "$$ w_{i} = \\frac {w_{i}}{S_{w}} $$\n",
    "$$ S_{w} = Summation\\ of\\ weights. $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Creating bins\n",
    "Bins are just ranges that are made by cumulative addition of normalised weights of data points upto the current one.\n",
    "$$ Bin_{i} = (C_{i-1}, C_{i}] $$\n",
    "$$ C_{i} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i} $$\n",
    "$$ n = number\\ of\\ records\\ till\\ i^{th}\\ record $$\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Data points given to next stump\n",
    "The next stump genrates a number $ r $ for each data point. $ r $ is a random number generated in range (0, 1).\\\n",
    "For each data point, we check $ r $ falls in which *bin*, and then we take the corresponding data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, as the data points with incorrect prediction have wider *bin range*, so the probability of them being choosen rises! That's how the next stumps gets trained on the previous model's mistakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "These all steps are repeated for the next stump too."

    "- We calculate weights of each prediction by normalising the performance scores (λ) so that they add up to 1.\n",
    "- We sort the predicted values\n",
    "- We calculated the cumulative weights for each, first value to have cumulative weight $ ≥ 0.5 $ is considered as final output."
