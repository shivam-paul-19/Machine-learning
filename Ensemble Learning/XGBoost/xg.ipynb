    "# **XGBoost**\n",
    "The XGBoost (eXtreme Gradient Boosting) algorithm is a powerful, optimized, and scalable open-source machine learning library that implements gradient boosted decision trees. It is a leading method for supervised learning on structured/tabular data, known for high performance in both speed and predictive accuracy. XGBoost is an ensemble learning method that builds models sequentially, with each new, simple decision tree (a \"weak learner\") attempting to correct the prediction errors (residuals) of all previous trees combined. This process is formalized as a gradient descent optimization problem to minimize a specified loss function. "
