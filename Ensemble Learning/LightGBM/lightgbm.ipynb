    "# **LightGBM** 💡\n",
    "LightGBM (Light Gradient Boosting Machine) is a high-performance, open-source distributed gradient boosting framework developed by Microsoft, specialized for efficient, scalable training on large datasets. It utilizes histogram-based, leaf-wise tree growth, and techniques like Gradient-based One-Side Sampling (GOSS) and Exclusive Feature Bundling (EFB) to achieve faster training speeds, lower memory usage, and higher accuracy compared to traditional methods.\n",

    "## The working (LightGBM Classification)\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Get a base prediction\n",
    "Just like XGBoost, we start with a naive guess for all data points (usually 0.5 probability or log(odds) of 0).\n",
    "\n",
    "$$p = \\text{Base probability}$$\n",
    "$$\\text{prediction}_{0} = \\log(\\frac{p}{1-p})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Calculate Gradients and Hessians\n",
    "In XGBoost, we calculated \"residuals\". In LightGBM, we formalize this as **Gradients ()** (First derivative) and **Hessians ()** (Second derivative).\n",
    "*Note: For classification, the Gradient is effectively the residual.*\n",
    "\n",
    "$$g_{i} = p_{i} - y_{i} \\quad (\\text{similar to residual } r_i)$$\n",
    "$$h_{i} = p_{i} * (1 - p_{i}) \\quad (\\text{weight of the data point})$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Apply GOSS (Gradient-based One-Side Sampling)\n",
    "*This is the unique \"Light\" step.* instead of using **all** data points to build the tree, LightGBM assumes data points with **small gradients** () are already well-trained.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Sort** all data points by their gradient .\n",
    "2. **Keep** the top a% of data points (large gradients).\n",
    "3. **Randomly Sample** b% from the remaining data (small gradients).\n",
    "4. **Amplify** the sampled small gradients by a constant factor $\\frac{1-a}{b}$ to keep the math balanced.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\text{Data Used} = \\text{Top } a\\% + \\text{Weighted Sample of } b\\%$$\n",
    "\n",
    "* #### Make the tree (Leaf-wise Growth)\n",
    "Unlike XGBoost which grows \"level-wise\" (layer by layer), LightGBM grows \"leaf-wise\". It hunts for the **single leaf** that yields the maximum profit and splits only that one.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a histogram-based algorithm to find the split. The decision is based on the **Gain**, calculated using our GOSS-weighted sums.\n",

    "\n",
    "* #### Make Prediction (Update)\n",
    "We update the log(odds) for each data point by adding the prediction from the new tree, scaled by the learning rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$v_{new} = v_{old} + \\eta * w$$\n",
