    "    Covariance measures the direction of a linear relationship between two variables. It calculates the extent to which two variables vary together from their respective means.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ Cov(x, y) = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_{i} - x')*(y_{i} - y')}{n-1} $$\n",

    "    $$ n = \\text{number of data points} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Positive Covariance: Both variables tend to increase or decrease together.\n",
    "    - Negative Covariance: One variable tends to increase as the other decreases.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlation**\n",
    "    Correlation is a standardised version of covariance that measures both the direction and strength of a linear relationship. It divides the covariance of two variables by the product of their standard deviations 1.1.7. This \"normalises\" the result to a fixed range between -1 and +1.\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$ \\text{Pearson Correlation of x and y} = \\frac{Cov(x, y)}{σ(x) * σ(y)} $$\n",
    "    $$ σ(x) = \\text{standard deviation of x} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If a feature have a correlation or covariance with the output, nearer to zero then it is safe to eleminate that feature."
