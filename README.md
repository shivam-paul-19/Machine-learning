# 📘 Machine Learning

This repository is a **personal learning journal + reference** for Machine Learning concepts and algorithms.

It is not just about *writing code*, but about **understanding why things work**, how models think, and where each algorithm makes sense.

The repo will keep growing as I explore more ML algorithms, ideas, and intuitions.

## 🎯 Purpose of this Repository

- Build **strong fundamentals** in Machine Learning
- Understand algorithms **conceptually + mathematically**
- Maintain **clean, well-explained notes** alongside code
- Create a long-term **revision & reference repo**
- Prepare for **interviews, projects, and real-world ML**

This repo is written in a way that **future-me** (and maybe others) can easily revisit and understand.
